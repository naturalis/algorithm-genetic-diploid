=head1 NAME

Algorithm::Genetic::Diploid::Population - A population of individuals that turns over

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

Constructor takes named arguments, creates a default, empty list of individuals

=cut

sub new {
	shift->SUPER::new(
		'individuals' => [],
		@_,
	);
}

=item individuals

Getter and setter for the list of individuals

=cut

sub individuals {
	my $self = shift;
	if ( @_ ) {
		$self->{'individuals'} = \@_;
		$log->info("assigning ".scalar(@_)." individuals to population");
	}
	return @{ $self->{'individuals'} };
}

=item turnover

Moves the population on to the next generation, i.e.
1. compute fitness of all individuals
2. mate up to reproduction rate in proportion to fitness
